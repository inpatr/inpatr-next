## History & Intro

JS based UI dev library
(NOT A FRAMEWORK)

frameworks: inversion of control (takes it) (f.e. angular)
library f. e. lodash

one single focus:
**CREATE COMPONENTS FOR WEB APPS**

- 2011 as side project of fb creator

VUE & React kinda opposite
vue - more new stuff in html
react - more html in js // or js in general

is super fast / rendering optimized
combination of writing html in js!!

show that you write js {}
super small api
className

even if it looks like HTML: **it's JS !!!**
